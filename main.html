                        The place was really big with tons of storage. There’s a separate sleeping that’s closed off and
                        private. Ideal for a family.<br><br>We were really disappointed with the cleanliness. Hair on
                        the
                        bed, moldy food in the fridge,
                        dirt all over the floor and surfaces. We had to change the bed sheets ourselves. I think the
                        place was good but if I went back I would contact the owner and confirm that it would be cleaned
                        first.<br><br>It’s also very damp so if you have mild issues I wouldn’t recommend.<br>Owner was
                        good
                        at communicating most of the time, just not during our stay.

                        I highly recommend staying at Rodney’s place while in Toronto! It is located a short walk from
                        the Bloor UP station making transportation to and from the airport very convenient. In addition,
                        the Landsdowne Subway station is close by as well as various street car lines making getting
                        around the city via public transportation easy. The city is also very walkable from this area
                        and there are numerous good places to eat close by.<br><br>For checking in, the keyless entry to
                        the
                        house and the room made this process a breeze and it<br>was super convenient to use throughout
                        my weeklong stay. The room was clean, quiet, and very
                        comfortable for a solo traveler. As a host, Rodney is friendly, helpful and keeps the kitchen
                        and bathroom very clean.<br><br>Overall, I really enjoyed staying at Rodney’s house and would
                        definitely recommend it to anyone
                        visiting Toronto!

                        It was my first experience with Airbnb and I’m glad that Himani was my first host. Unfortunately
                        I didn’t get to meet her since I was super busy and would go leave early and come back late, but
                        speaking to her on the phone or texting her and asking her about stuff was pleasant.<br>She was
                        super nice to us and very responsive. The house was amazing. It was very clean and everything
                        was provided.<br> It was even more complete than the most expensive hotels I have ever been to.
                        It completely felt like home and I got used to it pretty fast. I wish I didn’t have to leave and
                        could stay a few more days cause we were just so comfortable.<br><br>The place was nicely
                        designed
                        and
                        everything was new. At first I felt I was paying a tad too much for cleaning and services fees
                        but once I got there I realized that those fees were being used for our own comfort. There were
                        grocery shops right near us and street cars were just a 2 minutes walk away.

                        The pandemic has forced me into using Airbnb fairly regularly over the last year but if there is
                        a bright side to that its coming across people like Traevor. Great host is an
                        understatement.<br>He
                        stays out of your way until you need something and then when you do he is quick to respond and
                        invariably exceeds expectations. His place is very quaint.<br><br>Kind of like a homey cottage a
                        short
                        walk from Eglinton. Its an uphill walk so bring your sneakers but after initially thinking "I
                        can't do this every day" I got to the point where I enjoyed it and towards the end of my stay I
                        could do it without gasping for air at the top. So to summarize...the host is
                        awesome.<br><br>The
                        place
                        is great. AND if you stay long enough you get in better shape without even realizing. One of
                        my favourite places to stay. Very highly recommended. Will definitely book again.
